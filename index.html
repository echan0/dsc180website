        <h1>Evaluating Fungal Feature Importance in Predicting Life Expectancy for Cancer Patients</h1> 
        <h3>Benjamin Sacks, Ethan Chan, Mark Zheng</h3> 
        
        <h2>Background & Research Question</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    2 million Americans diagnosed with cancer every year
                </li>
                <li>
                    Previous work has been done to distinguish between cancer types with only fungal DNA from around the tumor
                </li>
                <li>
                    Can we learn about the progression of the cancer, as measured by cancer stage and days to death, if we incorporated data about the patient and sample as well?
                </li>
            </ul>
            
        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Fungal counts and metadata feature tables obtained from the TCGA cohort of the aforementioned study batch corrected to the WIS cohort
            </li>
            <li>
                Tissue samples were taken from and around tumors and then sequenced using ITS2 (WIS) and shotgun metagenomic approach (TCGA)
            </li>
            <li>
                For more detail, see: https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)01127-8
            </li>
        </ul>
        
    

        <h2>Methods Overview</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Metadata was preprocessed using One Hot Encoding and Ordinal Encoding and then merged with the fungal counts table
            </li>
            <li>
                Null values were imputed with the means of their respective columns
            </li>
            <li>
                For cancer stage classification, the data was fed through a Gradient Boost Classifier for each “stage vs all” classification with 10-folds cross validation
            </li>
            <li>
                For regression, the data was put through a lasso ridge regression with 10-folds cross validation and a Mean Squared Error loss function
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                We were able to classify each cancer stages vs all other stages with high accuracy, obtaining high AUROC (90+%) and AUPR (80+%) scores
            </li>
            <li>
                We were unsuccessful in being able to predict days to death through combining metadata and fungal counts data, obtaining very high loss
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Discover underlying biological grounds for strongly weighted features
            </li>
            <li>
                Explore if strategized fungal interruption for individuals of specific metadata profiles will have an effect on cancer resilience
            </li>
        </ul>
