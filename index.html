        <ul>
            2 million Americans diagnosed with cancer every year
        </ul>
        <ul>
            Previous work has been done to distinguish between cancer types with only fungal DNA from around the tumor
        </ul>
        <ul>
            Can we learn about the progression of the cancer, as measured by cancer stage and days to death, if we incorporated data about the patient and sample as well?
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Background & Research Question</h2>
        <ul>
            Fungal counts and metadata feature tables obtained from the TCGA cohort of the aforementioned study batch corrected to the WIS cohort
        </ul>
        <ul>
            Tissue samples were taken from and around tumors and then sequenced using ITS2 (WIS) and shotgun metagenomic approach (TCGA)
        </ul>
        <ul>
